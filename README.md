# DE-ElevatorFinalProject
#This project is created by Julie Saad and Emily Hoang. Our project features an elevator mechanism that integrates a motor and 2 ultrasonic sensors, and is controlled by Python code using the Pitop. In the elevator, there are two ultrasonic sensors. One on the top, looking into the carriage to detect objects that represent the "people" inside the elevator, and the other sensor is on the bottom looking down at the floor. The top sensor detects whether a passenger has entered the carriage and, depending on whether the carriage is on the upper floor or the ground floor (determined through a Boolean where groundFloor=True if on the ground floor and vise versa), will move to the other floor. The bottom sensor detects where the ground is in respect to the carriage. When the carriage reaches the height of either the ground floor or the upper floor, the motor will stop. The motor is configured with braking capabilities that drives the elevator's movement with adjustable RPM. The code monitors the sensors' data to control the elevator's direction and stopping points, switching between ground floor and elevated positions based on the measured distance from the ground. Moreover, the functionality of the elevator consists of a single motor and utilizes three pulleys, one attached to the motor and two additional pulleys that guide the rope, providing smoother movement due to their slightly slippery surfaces.
