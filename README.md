# DE-ElevatorFinalProject
#This project is created by Julie Saad and Emily Hoang. Our project features an elevator mechanism that integrats a motor and 2 ultrasonic sensors, and controlled by Python code using the Pitop. The first Ultrasonic sensor is positioned inside the elevator, facing downward, to detect obejcts or "people" inside the elevator. The second ultrasonic sensor mounted beneath the elevator to measure the distance to the ground, enabling the system to slow down and stop the motor at the appropriate height. The motor, configured with braking capabilities, drives the elevator's movement with adjustable RPM. The code monitors the sensors' data to control the elevator's direction and stopping points, switching between ground floor and elevated positions based on the measured distance from the ground. Moreover, the functionality of the elevator consists of a single motor and utilizes three pulleys, one attached to the motor and two additional pulleys that guide the rope, providing smoother movement due to their slightly slippery surfaces.
