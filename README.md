# DE-ElevatorFinalProject
#This project is created by Julie Saad and Emily Hoang. Our project features an elevator mechanism that integrats a motor and 2 ultrasonic sensors. The first sensor is positioned inside the elevator, facing downward, to detect obejcts or "people" inside the elevator. The second sensor mounted beneath the elevator to measure the distance from the ground, enabling the system to slow down and stop the motor at the appropriate height. The elevator operates with a single motor with a pulley and utilizes three pulleys, one attached to the motor and two additional pulleys that guide the rope, providing smoother movement due to their slightly slippery surfaces.
